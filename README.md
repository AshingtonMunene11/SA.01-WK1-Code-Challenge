# 🇰🇪 Everyday Essentials
Boda, Chai & M-Pesa Estimators

Welcome to a collection of three interactive, JavaScript-powered mini tools designed to bring Kenyan daily life experiences into code. Whether you're planning your next bodaboda ride, brewing the perfect cup of chai, or estimating your mobile money transfer fees—this set of simple prompts has you covered.

Each calculator works entirely in the browser using native JavaScript prompts, and outputs meaningful, contextual messages to the console.
