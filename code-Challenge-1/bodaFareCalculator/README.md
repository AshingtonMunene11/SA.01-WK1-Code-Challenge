Fare Calculation Rules:

Base Fare: KES 50 (applied to every ride).
Per Kilometer Charge: KES 15 for every kilometer traveled.
Your Task:

Write a JavaScript function named calculateBodaFare that:

Prompts the user to enter the distance of their trip in kilometers. Convert this input to a number.
Takes the distanceInKm (as a number) as an argument.
Calculates the total estimated fare using the formula: totalFare = baseFare + (distanceInKm * chargePerKm)
Prints the result to the console in a user-friendly format.
