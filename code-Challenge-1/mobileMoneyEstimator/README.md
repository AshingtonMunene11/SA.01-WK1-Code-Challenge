Write a JavaScript function named estimateTransactionFee that:

Prompts the user to enter the amount of money they wish to send. Convert this input to a number.
Takes the amountToSend (as a number) as an argument.
Calculates the transaction fee based on the 1.5% rule, ensuring it adheres to the minimum (KES 10) and maximum (KES 70) fee limits.
Hint: You'll likely need conditional logic (if-else if-else) or Math.min() and Math.max().
Calculates the total amount that will be debited (amount to send + transaction fee).
Prints the results to the console.
